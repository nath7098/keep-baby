This project has for goal to use Nuxt 3 to create a fullstack app that allows parents to centralize all informations
to the person that is going to keep their baby.

## Wanted Features

- **Assinable Todo list** : Parents can create multiple todo lists which can be **_public_** (every keepers attached to the child can see it) or **_private_** (only the assigned keeper can see it).
- **Health book** : Parents can add their child's health book (first by typing) <font color="green">evolution => scan ?</font>. It would be available only to keepers (maybe only during the "keep time" ?) 
- Home page's important informations 
- **_help page_** with emergencies contacts / parents' contacts.
- **_Tools_** for helping parents preparing the lists / informations -> <font color="green">**_Must be interactive, easy and fast !_**</font>


# Definitions

- **_public_** : Every keeper assigned to a child concerned by the todo list can see it. Nothing information (either profiles) will be accessible if you are not attached to a parent !
